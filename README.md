## Welcome to readme!

Hi! I just want to thank you for your interest in this plugin. I put a lot of effort into this project and I would really love someone to use it!

## What is a Shared Inventory?

With this fun little plugin, everyone shares the same inventory. This makes the gameplay very interesting!

## Commands

- `/sharedinventory add <player> <player> ... ` - adds players
- `/sharedinventory add @a` - adds all players
- `/sharedinventory remove <player> <player> ... ` - removes players
- `/sharedinventory remove @a` - removes all players
