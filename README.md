## Welcome to readme!

Hi! I just want to thank you for your interest in this plugin. I put a lot of effort into this project and I would really love someone to use it!

### Minecraft version

This plugin runs on a Minecraft version 1.16+.

## What is a Shared Inventory?

With this fun little plugin, everyone shares the same inventory. This makes the gameplay very interesting!

## How to use it

- drag the .jar file from the [Release tab](https://github.com/Matistan/MinecraftSharedInventory/releases) to your plugins folder on your server.
- create a game using `/sharedinventory create <game>`
- type `/sharedinventory start <game>` to start!
- if you don't want to play with every player on the server, change the rule `playWithEveryone` to false, and choose the players using `/sharedinventory add` command

## Commands

- `/sharedinventory add <game> <player> <player> ... ` - adds players to the game
- `/sharedinventory add <game> @a` - adds all players to the game
- `/sharedinventory remove <game> <player> <player> ... ` - removes players rom the game
- `/sharedinventory remove <game> @a` - removes all players from the game
- `/sharedinventory start <game>` - starts the game
- `/sharedinventory reset <game>` - resets the game
- `/sharedinventory list <game>` - shows a list of players in the game of shared inventory
- `/sharedinventory rules <rule> value(optional)` - changes some additional rules of the game (in config.yml)
- `/sharedinventory help` - shows a list of shared inventory commands

## Configuration Options

Use the command `/sharedinventory rules` or edit the `plugins/MinecraftSharedInventory/config.yml` file to change the following options:

| Key                 | Description                                                                                                                          | Type    | recommended                                                   |
