## Welcome to readme!

Hi! I just want to thank you for your interest in this plugin. I put a lot of effort into this project and I would really love someone to use it!

### Minecraft version

This plugin runs on a Minecraft version 1.16+.

## What is a Shared Inventory?

With this fun little plugin, everyone shares the same inventory. This makes the gameplay very interesting!

## How to use it

- drag the .jar file from the [Release tab](https://github.com/Matistan/MinecraftSharedInventory/releases) to your plugins folder on your server.
- select players to your game using `/sharedinventory add` command
- type `/sharedinventory start` to start!

## Commands

- `/sharedinventory add <player> <player> ... ` - adds players
- `/sharedinventory remove <player> <player> ... ` - removes players
- `/sharedinventory start` - starts the game
- `/sharedinventory reset` - resets the game
- `/sharedinventory list` - shows a list of players in the game of shared inventory
- `/sharedinventory help` - shows a list of shared inventory commands

## Configuration Options

Edit the `plugins/MinecraftSharedInventory/config.yml` file to change the following options:

| Key                 | Description                                                                 | Type    | recommended                                                   |

| usePermissions      | Set to true to require users to have permission to use certain commands.    | boolean | false; true if you don't trust the people you're playing with |
