## Welcome to readme!

Hi! I just want to thank you for your interest in this plugin. I put a lot of effort into this project and I would really love someone to use it!

## What is a Shared Inventory?

With this fun little plugin, everyone shares the same inventory. This makes the gameplay very interesting!

- select players to your game using `/sharedinventory add` command
- type `/sharedinventory start` to start!

## Commands

- `/sharedinventory add <player> <player> ... ` - adds players
- `/sharedinventory remove <player> <player> ... ` - removes players
- `/sharedinventory start` - starts the game
- `/sharedinventory reset` - resets the game
- `/sharedinventory list` - shows a list of players in the game of shared inventory
- `/sharedinventory help` - shows a list of shared inventory commands
